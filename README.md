# Unhandled Errors in Express.js POST Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient input validation and error handling in POST request handlers.  The `bug.js` file shows a vulnerable POST route that can fail silently or unexpectedly, while `bugSolution.js` demonstrates a more robust solution.

## Bug
The `bug.js` file shows a `POST /users` route that directly uses the request body without any checks or error handling. This is vulnerable to several issues:

* **Invalid Data:**  If the client sends malformed or incorrect data (e.g., missing fields or incorrect data types), it will likely lead to application crashes or unexpected behavior. 
* **Database Errors:**  Errors during database insertion (e.g., duplicate key errors) are not handled gracefully.
* **Security Risks:**  Improper validation leaves the application vulnerable to various attacks, such as SQL injection or data manipulation. 

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a significantly improved approach:

1. **Input Validation:** Validates `req.body` using a schema, ensuring that the data sent by the client matches the expected structure and data types.  This prevents invalid data from reaching the database.
2. **Error Handling:**  Implements comprehensive error handling (try...catch blocks) to catch and gracefully handle database errors. The response provides helpful error messages to the client.
3. **Clear Responses:**  Uses appropriate HTTP status codes and response messages to communicate the outcome of the request to the client.
